# DHCP Dynamic DNS Update
Two containers impelementing ISC DNS and DHCP servers for demonstration and
testing of DHCP dynamic DNS updates. Never use those two in production. They are
vulnerable, buggy and not updated.

They are used in the following GNS3 project: [dhcp/dhcp-dynamic-dns-update](https://github.com/mmsrubar/gns3/tree/main/dhcp/dhcp-dynamic-dns-update "dhcp/dhcp-dynamic-dns-update")
